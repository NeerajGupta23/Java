1. List the Operators in Java
Ans => Java provides various types of operators that allow you to perform different kinds of operations 
        on variables and values. These include Arithmetic Operators +, -, *, /, %, Relational Operators ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=,
        Logical Operators &&, ||, !, Bitwise Operators &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>, Assignment Operators =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc., 
        Unary Operators +, -, ++, --, !, Ternary Operator ?:, and Instanceof Operator.  



2. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give examples
Ans => The increment operator ++ increases a variable’s value by 1, while the decrement operator -- decreases 
        it by 1. They come in two forms: prefix ++a, --a and postfix a++, a--. Prefix changes the value before use, 
        and postfix changes it after.



3. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Ans => Conditional operators, also known as ternary operators, are used to assign a value based on a condition. It uses the 
        condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false, eg. String status = (a == b) ? "equal" : "not equal"; 



4. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans => Operators in Java can be classified based on the number of operands:
        => Unary Operators (one operand): e.g., ++a, --b, !flag.
        => Binary Operators (two operands): e.g., a + b, x > y.
        => Ternary Operator (three operands): e.g., condition ? a : b.


5. What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Ans => Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on conditions. Java supports if, if else, if else if, 
        and switch statements. These are used to make decisions based on boolean expressions.


6. What is the syntax of if-else statement?
Ans => The if-else statement evaluates a condition: if it’s true, the if block executes; otherwise, 
        the else block executes. The syntax is: in question6.java


7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in Java?
Ans => Java supports three primary looping constructs:
        for loop – used when the number of iterations is known.
        while loop – used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.
        do-while loop – like while, but executes the loop body at least once.


8. What do you mean by an Array?
Ans => An array is a data structure in Java that stores multiple values of the same type in a single variable. 
        Arrays are indexed, starting from 0, and have a fixed size once declared.

10. State the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in Java
Ans => Both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are used to create mutable (modifiable) strings in Java. The key difference is 
        that StringBuffer is thread-safe (synchronized), while StringBuilder is not, making StringBuilder faster in single-threaded 
        environments. Use StringBuffer when working with multi-threaded programs.
